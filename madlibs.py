print(f"""I woke up on Saturday morning with a {adjective3} hampering. 
I jumped to my feet as I heard my stomach make a strange sound. A {noise1}. 
This wasn't a normal stomach noise. Only one thing could cure my hunger:
my mother's famous {dessert1}. I {verb1} to the kitchen, trying to rememeber how it was made. 
I couldn't ask my mother since we were currently arguing over my lack of indpendence. 
Maybe she had a point. I opened my fridge and glanced inside. 
The food options were scarce: {food1}, {food2}, and {drink1}. 
All of which were stocked by my mother. Maybe she really did have a solid point. 
I grabbed my keys and ran outside. I saw my {adjective1} car, a {car1}. 
I hopped in and pressed my {bodypart1} down on the brake. I arrived at the store, {store1}. 
It was a {adjective2} store, with foods lining every aisle. 
I {adverb1} grabbed the ingredients I needed: {food3}, {food4}, {food5}, and {food6}. 
I raced back to my house in hopes of conquering my hunger. 
Long story short, I have no clue how to bake (maybe my mother really has a point). 
But at the very least the once cold morning got a little hotter as I stood outside and watched my house alight in a {color1} ember. 
Well at least I wouldn't have to pay my mortgage next month. I should really call my mom.
